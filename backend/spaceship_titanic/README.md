# Spaceship Titanic Competition

## Overview
This project aims to predict which passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension during a collision with a spacetime anomaly. The project is part of a Kaggle competition: [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).

## Competition Details
- **Task**: Binary classification
- **Target**: Predict whether a passenger was transported (True/False)
- **Evaluation Metric**: Classification accuracy
- **Submission Format**: CSV file with PassengerId and Transported columns

## Setup Status
- [x] Project structure created
- [ ] Kaggle API authentication (pending)
- [ ] Data download
- [ ] Data preprocessing implementation
- [ ] Model development
- [ ] Training pipeline
- [ ] Submission generation

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies (requirements will be added once determined)
2. Configure Kaggle API authentication
3. Run data download script (to be implemented)
4. Execute preprocessing pipeline
5. Train model
6. Generate predictions

## Notes
- Competition focuses on binary classification with tabular data
- Submission requires predictions in True/False format
- Project is set up to follow best practices for ML development
